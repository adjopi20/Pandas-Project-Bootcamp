# Pandas-Project-Bootcamp
Hi and welcome to my portfolio.
My name is JOPI ADRIANTO DOLOKSARIBU and this is my first data analysis project I made from a bootcamp i attend to.
This repository will include the jupyter notebook result and the source file of the dataset used in the project.
In this project i used Pandas and Numpy libraries as the main data analysis tools.
Furthermore, i also used matplotlib and seaborn as the data visualization tools.
The environment i used to write the code is Jupyter Notebook.

Should you have any question, feel free to contact me at [jopi.adrianto@gmail.com](mailto:jopi.adrianto@gmail.com)
